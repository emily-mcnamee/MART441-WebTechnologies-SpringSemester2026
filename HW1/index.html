          <hr>
          <p class="mx-auto px-3" style="max-width: 80%"><b>You should choose me for commission</b> because I blend professional-grade execution with a deep understanding of what today’s online audiences actually connect with. I’m highly skilled across the Adobe Creative Cloud, allowing me to move fluidly from concept to polished final artwork with precision, efficiency, and flexibility—whether that means dramatic compositions, clean linework, or cinematic color grading. <br><br><b>As a digital artist shaped by the internet,</b> I don’t just create art that looks good; I create art that feels current, shareable, and emotionally resonant in modern digital spaces. Drawing inspiration from high fantasy and comic book art styles, my work combines epic storytelling, dynamic anatomy, and bold visual impact, resulting in pieces that feel both timeless and fresh. The result is artwork that doesn’t just exist on the page or screen, but grabs attention, sparks imagination, and leaves a lasting impression.</p><br>

        <h1 style="color:black;"> Memory of a Game </h1>
        <hr style="color: black;">
        <p class="mx-auto px-3" style="max-width: 80%; color:black"><b style="color:black"> One of my most prominent game memories</b> was playing The Legend of Zelda: The WindWaker for the Wii U as a pre-teen. The game's map is a vast ocean, as its explained at the beginning that the Gods flooded the land of Hyrule to seal the King of Demons away. You have to usually sail for in-game hours between islands; finding treasure and fighting oceaneanic monsters along the trip. The sailing time between islands leaves you a while to contemplate your next plan and to take in the sights.  <br><br> During one of these long-haul sailing trips to get to an island on the other side of the map, I remember wondering why the world was so sparsely populated; save for a few main islands, the world was almost meloncholichally empty of friendly life. Then, a realization that was far too sobering for a 10-13 year old hit me; the reason that the human population was so small was because they were the descendants of the few people that survived the apolocyliptic flood. <br><br>
        While the meta reason is probably because there simply wasn't a good reason for the game developers to try to make more than a few human NPCs, wether intentional or not, it was an unforgettable reading of environmental storytelling that stayed with me, even now.
