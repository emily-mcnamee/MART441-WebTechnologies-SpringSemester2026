### Reflection Questions:

ChatGPT's game was actually quite in-depth, and actually made a better decision in my opinion by choosing to keep one submission box and button throughout the entire game, making the code easier to navigate and shorter. I'm not particularly a fan of how the LM decided to change the background color for changing the "style" of the game, however that could be easily changed around with manual coding. I think the AI choosing to organize its game using a 'scene' variable is also an easier way to do this kind of assignment. The 'health' variable is useless however, as there's no visual update to show the player its a changing game variable besides the text saying so.
