# Webpage and code created for MART441 - Homework 3

### Reflection Questions:

Errors: At first I had labeled both 'choice' scripts as both 'choice1', making the console send a TypeError report about an innerHTML being 'null'. I thought this meant that I forgot to do something that caused the .innerHTML part of the "document.getElementById("choice1").innerHTML" line of code to work. After about half an hour of glaring at the cheatsheet and my own code, I finally found my mistake and it ran smooth. That sucked.
