To retrieve a value from an array, we use square brackets and an index:

var food1 = food[0];

This retrieves the first item in the array. Remember: arrays start at 0, so the last index is always (length - 1).

To update an item, you use the same bracket syntax and assign a new value:


food[0] = "peaches";
  
Now the first element is "peaches" instead of "apple".

One of the most important array properties is length. It tells you how many items are in the array — and it’s why our loop works even if the array grows.
